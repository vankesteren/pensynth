Description: Estimate penalized synthetic control models
    and perform hold-out validation to determine their 
    penalty parameter. This method is based on the work by
    Abadie & L'Hour (2021) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2021.1971535>.
    Penalized synthetic controls smoothly interpolate between 
    one-to-one matching and the synthetic control method.
